# ios-automation-assets
The CI/CD pipelines publishes notification updates and uses certain assets as part of these notifications. 
In most cases these assets (images) need to be publicly available to be rendered. 
For example, posting slack messages require image links that needs to be publicly available. 

This repository hosts the needed public assets.
